## Diamond-Price-Calculator 
With this program, you can calculate Diamond Prices.

# Step 1: Environment Setup
Web Server: Ensure you have a web server (like Apache or Nginx) installed. If you're on a local machine, you can use solutions like XAMPP (for Windows), MAMP (for Mac), or LAMP/WAMP (for Linux/Windows).
PHP Support: Make sure your web server has PHP installed and configured correctly. Most servers like XAMPP or MAMP come with PHP pre-installed.

# Step 2: File Preparation
Create a Project Folder: Make a new folder in your web server's root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP, www for WAMP, or public_html for live servers). You can name this folder anything, like diamond_calculator.
Create HTML File: Inside your project folder, create an HTML file named index.html. Paste the HTML code provided earlier.
Create CSS File: Also inside your project folder, create a CSS file named style.css. Paste the CSS code provided to enhance your form's visual appeal.
Create PHP File: Create a file named calculate.php in the same folder. Paste the PHP code that processes the form data and calculates the diamond price.

# Step 3: Testing Locally
Start Your Web Server: If you're using XAMPP, MAMP, or any similar solution, start the server using its control panel.
Open Your Browser: Launch a web browser and navigate to your project. If you're using a local server and named your project folder diamond_calculator, the URL might look like http://localhost/diamond_calculator/index.html.
Use the Calculator: Fill in the form and submit it to see the diamond price calculation.

# Step 4: Deployment
To make your Diamond Price Calculator accessible on the internet, you need to deploy it to a live server. The steps vary depending on your hosting provider but generally involve:
# Choosing a Web Host: Select a hosting provider that supports PHP.
Upload Your Files: Use FTP/SFTP or your host's control panel to upload your project folder (diamond_calculator) to your server's root directory (often public_html or www).
Access Your Project: Navigate to your project's URL based on your domain name, like http://yourdomain.com/diamond_calculator/index.html.

# Troubleshooting Tips
PHP Not Working: Make sure .php files are being processed by your server. If you're testing locally and it's not working, check your server's configuration.
Form Submission Errors: Ensure the action attribute in your form tag correctly points to calculate.php.
Permissions Issues: If you're deploying to a live server and encountering permission errors, ensure your files have the correct permissions set.
